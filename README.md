# Fatboy Home Network Installer 

## Media Library 

## Library Directories 

Paths given in the main read me. All paths need to be created as part of library install 

## Queue File  

The queue requires the a  queue file to exist, even it empty. Install needs to add a queue file to the system location, the file is a simple text file and can be created using Notepad or `open(PATH),'x')`
